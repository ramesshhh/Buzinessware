                    <p class="my-4">Microsoft created and programmed the Remote Desktop Protocol. It is only used to link several machines or servers remotely. <strong>RDP</strong>  software must be installed on the computer that will be used as the target, and an RDP client must be installed on the computer that will connect to the target. When it comes to connecting to a machine in a unique location such as the United Arab Emirates, the good news is that we can take care of this for you dependably and cost-effectively. Many servers are only set up to deploy this feature for Shared Remote Desktop needs. At the same time, you can purchase a plan with dedicated resources that allows you to conduct all other functions that an online service provides.</p>
